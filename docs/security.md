# Security

## Local Trust Boundary

The local server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. It is not intended to be exposed as a LAN or internet service.

Every API route enforces the literal loopback boundary and request
context (Host, Origin, fetch metadata) before body consumption. Every
route except token issuance requires a short-lived launch token bound to
its browser session; download handles are session-bound, leased to one
transfer, and consumed after the first completed download.

## File Handling

- The original input path is never overwritten; export always creates a
  new PDF and source hashes stay unchanged across all terminal states.
- Temporary job directories are isolated per job with fixed caps on
  uploads, outputs, pages, runtime, retained artifacts, and aggregate
  storage.
- Validation rejects non-PDF files, encrypted PDFs, signed PDFs, and
  active content (JavaScript, open/additional/launch actions,
  submit/import, rich media, embedded files) before any mutation.
- Compression and page-export errors return local error codes rather than
  partial success; no partial output is downloadable.

## External Tools

The shared core calls local PDF tools through adapter modules with
argument arrays (no shell), closed stdin, a minimal environment, and
process-group termination.

- `qpdf` (>= 12.4.1, required) performs inspection and the single
  page-selection assembly mutation per export.
- Ghostscript (>= 10.07.1, optional) creates post-assembly compression
  candidates that only win when smaller and valid.

Versions below either floor fail closed. Native parsing still runs with
the user account's filesystem authority unless packaging adds OS
isolation; upstream parser/resource-exhaustion fixes are pending a later
release.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please report security issues through GitHub Security Advisories when available, or by opening a minimal public issue that does not include private PDFs, document content, credentials, or exploit payloads.
